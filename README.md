## Overview 
For this project, I built a responsive page by using a mobile-first approach. I started off with a mobile version and then added breakpoints using media queries for the larger screen sizes. The layout accommodates small, medium, and large screen sizes. For this project, I was tasked with building all the HTML and CSS myself by using the provided mockups as a guide. 

## Skills
- HTML
- CSS
- Media Queries
- Responsive Images
- Testing and debugging

## Conclusion
At the end of this project, I learned how to write all of the HTML and CSS by myself. Since using a mobile-first approach, I learned how media queries work and implemented them into my project for the tablet and desktop versions. I also learned how responsive images work and ensured the images in my project were responsive. Since adding in my own HTML and CSS some issues came up and I used the Dev Tools to test and debug my code.
